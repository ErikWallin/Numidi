Numidi
======

The word Numidi is an asian word those who play with numbers for a long time. The goal is to remove all numbers at the board. Numbers can be removed pairwise if numbers are the same, or the sum is ten. The game was written as an attempt to save my wife from solving the puzzle by pen and paper.
